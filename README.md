# Corridor Digital Office Reconstruct Unity
A rough attempt at reconstructing the Corridor Digital office space in Unity as a VR demo.

## What is this project?
This Unity project is my attempt at reconstructing the office space belonging to the Corridor Digital YouTube channel. In one of their videos, they challenged the viewers to draw out a map of the office by only using videos as reference. Although this challenge was a while ago, I decided to take on the task anyways in a novel way. After about a week of watching videos from the Corridor Crew, Freddiew/RocketJump, and BrandonJLa channels, and another week of building in Unity, the basic map was complete.

## Why bother?
You might be wondering why someone would go through the trouble to create something like this, and it's certainly a valid question. At first, I just wanted a fun little side project to work on and this ended up being the perfect task. But after actually going through the time and effort to make this, I decided to release what I'd done to the internet to see if anyone could make a novel game or have some practical use for it.
